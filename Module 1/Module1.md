# Overview
During this module, the primary objective was to design and carry out an experiment to analyze the effects of various conditions have on the growth dynamics of _E.coli_.

Two main experiments were conducted:
<ul>
  <li>calculate the ideal innoculation cell density</li>
  <li>calculate Monod kinetics constants by measuring growth rate at varying glucose concetrations</li>
</ul>

Using data collected, a conclusion could be reached about each experiment.
